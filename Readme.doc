Bonus: Write a couple of sentences on how you would interact with web service and what errors you would typically handle.
While interacting with web services, we'd check for 
 - status code (2xx indicates success, anything else indicates a problem)
 - Ideally, the API returns a useful error message that we can bind to the app and provide user that message to help identify the problem.
   - We can use exception handling (try catch) for that
   - libraries like axios have in built objects that we can use to exract error message (example: error.response)
   - we can also setup a re-try method that will retry sending the request a specified number of times 
     example: 
            axiosRetry(axios, {
              retries: 2,
              retryDelay,
              // retry on Network Error & 5xx responses
              retryCondition: axiosRetry.isRetryableError,
            });
